# nasmPlayground

This is my playground for learning x86 assembly. Work in progress, So don't expect it to work ;)

## Current projects:
* fibonacci - A fibonacci implementation
* [nullB00t - A simple bootloader](./nullB00t/readme.md)

## How to build:
You need:
*  linux x68_64
*  nasm
*  ld 

`make fibonacci clean` e.g. to build only one project

`make all clean` to build all projects
